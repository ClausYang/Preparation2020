# 771 Jewels and Stones

https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/

You're given strings `J` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `S` representing the stones you have. Each character in `S` is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in `J` are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in `J` and `S` are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so `"a"` is considered a different type of stone from `"A"`.

### My Solution

Use 2 `for`criculations, find the `J` and `S` elements seperately.

```java
class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
        int count=0;
        for(int i=0;i<J.length();i++){
            for(int j=0;j<S.length();j++){
                if(J.charAt(i) == S.charAt(j)) count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

Here, in the problem they mention that **J** string has unique characters. So, we are traversing each character from **S** string and if we found index of that character in **J** string **[i.e., whatever the index we can end up that character is present in J string, *if that character is not found, it will be -1*] ,** then increase the result by 1. Finally return the result.

```java
class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
       int res=0;
       for(char c : S.toCharArray()){
           if(J.indexOf(c) != -1){
               res++;
           }
       }
       return res;
    }
}
```

Here, we are going to traverse **J** string. For each character found in **S** string, we are removing multiple occurrence of those characters from **S** string. Finally, subtraction of total length and current **S** string length will be the result.

```java
class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
        int len = S.length(), len1=J.length();
        for(int i=0;i<len1;i++)
        {
            //this equals to delete the character which in both J ans S
            S = S.replaceAll(J.charAt(i)+"","");
        }
        return len-S.length();
    }
}
```

### Other points

`String`

Find the element at `i`: `str.charAt(i)`

Find the first appearance of character `c`, if not, return `-1`: `str.indexOf(c)`

Change the string to the array: `str.toCharArray()`

Normal replace: `str.replace(oldster, newstr)`

Regular expression replace: `str.replaceAll(regex, newstr)`
