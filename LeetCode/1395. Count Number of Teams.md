There are `n` soldiers standing in a line. Each soldier is assigned a **unique** `rating` value.

You have to form a team of 3 soldiers amongst them under the following rules:

- Choose 3 soldiers with index (`i`, `j`, `k`) with rating (`rating[i]`, `rating[j]`, `rating[k]`).
- A team is valid if: (`rating[i] < rating[j] < rating[k]`) or (`rating[i] > rating[j] > rating[k]`) where (`0 <= i < j < k < n`).

Return the number of teams you can form given the conditions. (soldiers can be part of multiple teams).

## Example 1:

```
Input: rating = [2,5,3,4,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can form three teams given the conditions. (2,3,4), (5,4,1), (5,3,1). 
```

## Solution

Use to arrays to store the res. First find the middle number, and than search each number to put them to the 2 arrays:

`left[0]`: index less than middle and number less than middle.

`left[1]`: index less than middle and number more than middle.

`right[0]`: index more than middle and number less than middle.

`right[1]`: index more than middle and number more than middle.

```java
class Solution {
    public int numTeams(int[] rating) {
        int res = 0;
        for(int i=1;i<rating.length-1;i++){
            int[] left = new int[2];
            int[] right = new int[2];
            for(int j=0;j<rating.length;j++){
                if(j<i) left[rating[i]<rating[j]? 0:1]++;
                if(j>i) right[rating[i]<rating[j]? 0:1]++;
            }
            res += left[0]*right[1]+left[1]*right[0];
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
