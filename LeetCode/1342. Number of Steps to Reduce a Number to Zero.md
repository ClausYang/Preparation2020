https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-steps-to-reduce-a-number-to-zero/

Given a non-negative integer `num`, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero. If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it.

### My Solution

Divide the number to odd and even number, use different strategies.

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfSteps (int num) {
        int i=0;
        while(num != 0){
            if(num%2==0) num /= 2;
            else num -= 1;
            i++;
        }
        return i;
    }
}
```
